# TensorFlow Lite Micro - Hello World


This application demonstrates a model trained to replicate a sine function. 
The model is continuously fed with values ranging from 0 to 2pi, and the output 
of the model is used to control the intensity of an LED. Inference results are 
also printed over VCOM. 


This is a port of TensorFlow's hello world application. For details about the 
application or information on how to train your own model, visit the TensorFlow
