# TensorFlow Lite Micro - Micro Speech


This application demonstrates a model trained to recognize the words "yes" and 
"no" from speech data recorded from the microphone. The detected keywords are 
transmitted over VCOM. LED 0 is toggled every time model inference is performed 
to give an indication of the processing speed of the model.


This application is a port of TensorFlow's micro speech application. For details 
about the application or information on how to train your own model, visit 
TensorFlow's **[GitHub page](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/v2.3.1/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech)**.
